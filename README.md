# 📄 README.md — Wine Quality Prediction App
# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction App

A Machine Learning web application built using **Streamlit** and **Logistic Regression** to classify red wine as **Good Quality** or **Bad Quality** based on chemical properties.

 📌 Project Overview
The application predicts wine quality using physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar, sulphates, alcohol, and pH.

Wine quality is converted into binary labels:

- Good Wine → Quality ≥ 7  
- Bad Wine → Quality < 7  

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  

 📂 Dataset
